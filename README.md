ðŸš€ Salesforce Task Management Project
This project includes:
âœ… A Custom Object (Task__c) for managing tasks
âœ… A Lightning Web Component (LWC) for displaying tasks
âœ… An Apex Batch/Queueable Job for auto-completing overdue tasks
âœ… An Apex REST API (TaskRestService.cls) to fetch tasks via HTTP
âœ… Deployment and Testing Instructions


ðŸ“Œ Prerequisites
Before deploying, ensure you have:

âœ… Salesforce CLI installed
âœ… A Dev Hub-enabled Salesforce org

# Deployment Steps
ðŸ”¹ 1.1 Authenticate Salesforce CLI with Your Dev Hub:
    sfdx auth:web:login -d -a DevHub
    This opens up a login page to the salesforce.org
ðŸ”¹ 1.2 Deploy Code to Salesforce:
    sf project deploy start --target-org <username>(salesforce.org)
    Ensure to enable communication between cli and the org.

# Accessing & Testing the LWC (taskList)
  Create a Lightning App Page
  Go to Salesforce Setup â†’ App Builder
  Click New Lightning Page â†’ Lightning App Page
  Drag & Drop the taskList component into the page
  Save & Activate

# Running & Testing the Apex Batch/Queueable Job
  Run Manually from Developer Console
    Open Developer Console
    Go to Debug â†’ Open Execute Anonymous Window
    Run the following command:
      system.enqueueJob(new CompleteOverdueTasksBatch());
    Check results in Setup â†’ Apex Jobs

# Testing the Apex REST Endpoint
  Get All Tasks Using cURL
    curl -X GET -H "Authorization: Bearer YOUR_ACCESS_TOKEN" \
    "https://your-org-instance.salesforce.com/services/apexrest/tasks"

  or using postman:
  Open postman
  set method to GET
  and enter the following url:
    https://your-org-instance.salesforce.com/services/apexrest/tasks
  Under headers enter:
    Authorization: Bearer YOUR_ACCESS_TOKEN
  click send

# Known Limitations & Assumptions
  Authentication â†’ The REST API requires a valid Salesforce access token.
  Batch Job Scheduling â†’ The job must be manually scheduled if automation is required.
  LWC Availability â†’ The component works only in Lightning Experience, not Classic.
  Error Handling â†’ The REST API returns a 500 error if something goes wrong.
